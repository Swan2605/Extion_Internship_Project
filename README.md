Extion Internship Project
Overview
This repository contains the tasks completed during my Cybersecurity Internship at Extion Infotech. The internship involved hands-on experience in performing vulnerability assessments and investigating cybersecurity incidents. Key learnings included using industry-standard tools and methodologies to analyze, mitigate, and document security vulnerabilities and breaches.

Projects
1. Task 1: Network Vulnerability Assessment
Conducted a comprehensive vulnerability assessment of a simulated network using tools like Nessus and OpenVAS.
Identified 18 critical vulnerabilities, including weak authentication, SQL injection risks, and insecure configurations.
Developed and implemented detailed mitigation strategies to enhance the network's security posture.
2. Task 2: Investigation of a Data Breach
Investigated a simulated data breach at a financial institution (ABC Secure Bank).
Analyzed the root cause (unpatched API endpoint and SQL injection attack) and assessed its impact on customer data.
Developed incident response strategies and compliance plans with GDPR and CCPA regulations.
